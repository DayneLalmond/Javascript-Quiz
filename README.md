## Description

An attempt to create a javascript quiz. I have put a lot of comments to break down what I was trying to accomplish. However, I have spent a long time
on that function alone and have ultimately decided I will need to break it down into separated functions. I will continue to work on this.

## Features

Features are limited to starting a quiz to display a single question and a timer.
